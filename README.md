Logins

Two test logins are provided 'test' and 'test2' with both passwords set to '123456'.

Admin section principles
========================
All admin section controllers/models should extend the base controller/model, this stops there being repeated code in every controller/model. As a minimum for an admin section you must have the following files:

* **Controller** - Set some class properties and have a basic __construct() method.  
* **i18n** - Language file.  
* **Model** - Set some class constants and database fields.  
* **Views** - Sub folder in views/ containing tab templates  

You can easily extend/amend functionality by overriding the default methods contained in the base controller or model, you can acheive this either by having the same named method or by overriding, running the parent method and then performing your own logic. I.e. parent::method($args);

Example 1 shows how minimal a section can be, no extending and simply relying on the functionality of the base controllers. Example 2 shows how you can change/extend certain things, it has custom validation rules (Model), custom field layout (tab-0.php) and custom template variables set (Controller).

Fields
------
There are 9 supported field types: Checkbox, File, Input, Input Date, Input Number, Input Password, Radio, Select and Textarea. For each field in the model a type is set, this is then used to load corresponding view which contains the markup and logic for that type.

Database table schema
=====================
For consistency all database tables and columns should use the following convention..  

* Table name should be plural of the object that it is representing.. I.e. for page the table name would be pages, etc.
* Column names should be prefixed the singular name of that object.. I.e. for pages table the column would be page_.
* Tables should always have the following fields: \_status(int), \_created_date(datetime), \_updated_date(datetime), \_deleted(int), \_deleted_date(datetime) and \_last_editor(int).

Improvements
============
Obviously normally you wouldn't use Kohana 2 as it's a bit dated now, however it's the framework I personally have most experience with. Saying that, it does the job - better than Procedural non [OOP code](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1530868/simple-explanation-php-oop-vs-procedural). If I were to use a modern framework I'd use either [laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) or [kohana 3](https://github.com/kohana/kohana).

* **Modules** - Separate out code in to modules: base, admin, admin sections etc
* **JavaScript** - Use a JavaScriptâ€Ž framework to better architect the logic, making it easily readable and extendable
 
WIP / Not finished
============

* **Searching** - Need to figure out how the top search bar would work searching all items
* **Multi-File-Upload** - You can't remove items from Multi File Uploader after they've been added
* **Date time fields** - Need to add datetime and time only field type
